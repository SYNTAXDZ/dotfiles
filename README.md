my config files for my i3wm configuration

for this config to work in your system:
- make sure i3wm is installed and working
and replace the config file in .i3 dir,
- and install polybar to get a nice panel
and replace the directory in home dir,
- install the awesome-fonts and others nice ones
in your system to get the nice cahracters in the panel
- and install jgmenu/rofi to get a launcher
for your applications.
- to get the power-tray you have to go to the power settings
and activate it from there (if you don't want to set one your self in polybar config)
- and don't forget to replace the .Xresources
file to get some effects.
